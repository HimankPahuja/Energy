       <p>Solar energy is the energy given off by the sun’s rays. Plants use sunlight to produce their own food by a process called photosynthesis. Using the sun’s rays plants transform water and carbon dioxide (what we exhale) into fuel to grow, and breathe out oxygen in the process. Also, humans for centuries have made use of the sun’s energy: for cooking, heating buildings, drying food, heating water, and generating electrical energy.  </p>
       <p>A solar cell is what converts sunlight into electricity. Well, the solar cells in a plant are called chloroplasts, collecting sunlight and transforming it into usable energy. When we use the sun to generate energy the solar cells are called photovoltaic or PV cells. Photovoltaic (meaning “light electricity”) cells convert the sun’s energy into electrical power. The cells are made up of materials that can carry electrical current and help capture light. The sun’s rays are made up of tiny particles of light energy. When the sunlight hits a photovoltaic cell, it is either reflected, passes right through, or is absorbed (just like when a plants chloroplast cells absorb light). Only absorbed light provides energy that can be used for electricity. </p> 
       <p>A solar panel is made up of groups of solar cells. The panels must be carefully positioned to get the maximum amount of sun exposure in order to convert the most energy possible. In the US (and anywhere else in the northern portion of the Earth), you’ll find most solar panels facing south. When the sun is at its highest point in the sky, the sun shines from the south side. Once the sun hits the panels, the energy is made into electricity. A solar inverter helps turn the electricity into power that can be used. The more panels you have on a roof, the more solar electricity you produce! The average home or business can have 50-75% of the power they use come from solar energy! </p>
       <p>Solar energy is good for the planet! It does not create pollution like energy from coal and oil. We waste energy to make power from coal and oil. No energy is wasted when using solar power! </p>
