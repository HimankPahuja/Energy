    <p>Mechanical Energy also known as motion energy, is how an object moves based on its position and motion. It occurs when a force acts upon an object and the object uses the transferred energy as movement. If an object is moving, it is using mechanical energy. </p>
    <p>Mechanical energy is one of the only types of energy that is easy to see. If something is moving, it is using mechanical energy! Below are some of the sources of mechanical energy that we’re likely to find in the home. </p> 
       <p>Turning a doorknob  </p>
       <p>Breathing in and out </p>
       <p>Hammering a nail </p>
        <p>Riding a bicycle </p>
        <p>Sharpening a pencil </p>
        <p>Using kitchen appliances </p>
        <p>There are two types of mechanical energy: potential energy (stored energy of position) and kinetic energy (energy of motion). Any object that is moving is using kinetic mechanical energy. Even objects that are not moving are storing potential mechanical energy. When you move something with your hand, you’ve transferred kinetic mechanical energy from your body to the object you are moving. </p>
