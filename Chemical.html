       <p>Chemical energy is a form of energy. It is energy that is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules.Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. They can be combined with other atoms to form molecules. Chemical energy is what holds the atoms in a molecule together. It is also what holds molecules in a substance together. </p>
       <p>When bonds between atoms are formed or broken, chemical reactions occur. A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances are converted to one or more different substances. In a reaction, the atoms of the starting substances are rearranged. The new arrangement forms new substances with different properties. Energy plays an important role in chemical reactions. Breaking bonds requires energy, and forming bonds releases energy. Heat energy is often used to break bonds. Heat energy is also often released when bonds are formed. </p> 
       <p>Chemical energy is a form of potential energy that is in all substances. Food is the most important source of chemical energy for living things. The chemical energy in food is converted, or changed, by the body into moving mechanical energy and heat energy. </p>
       <p>People have invented ways to use the chemical energy of substances to power machines. For example, the chemical energy inside the substances in a battery can be transformed into electrical energy to power a flashlight. The chemical energy of gasoline that is burned in a car engine changes into the moving mechanical energy of the car. </p>
